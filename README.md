# Troubleshooting

**ERROR**: [ScriptName] cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.

**SOLUTION**: Enable running PowerShell scripts by adjusting the Execution Policy on your system.

Use the execution policy that allows the script to work.

The Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet enables you to determine which Windows PowerShell scripts (if any) will be allowed to run on your computer. 

Windows PowerShell has four different execution policies:

* Restricted - No scripts can be run. Windows PowerShell can be used only in interactive mode.
* AllSigned - Only scripts signed by a trusted publisher can be run.
* RemoteSigned - Downloaded scripts must be signed by a trusted publisher before they can be run.
* Unrestricted - No restrictions; all Windows PowerShell scripts can be run.

To assign a particular policy simply call Set-ExecutionPolicy followed by the appropriate policy name. For example, this command run in a PowerShell console sets the execution policy to RemoteSigned:

`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

To run this in a Command Prompt console, use the following command:

`PowerShell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
